The stock market of consisting of people, invest money in your favorite actors, singers and celebrities and see it grow or fall.

A new type of asset class which is tied to the likeness/reputation of individuals. Everybody has a coin which will have their name on it and other individuals can directly invest in them. The people who invest get to realize profits provided the person’s likeness increases and vice versa.
What are social currencies?
Each profile of any person can be invested upon, each of these individual entities are what we call “social currencies”.


The creators and the users will be better and more deeply connected as:
Users get:
Potential monetary benefit from the creators they invest in.
To participate in the decisions made by the creator, as creators can have reward systems like having meetings, lunches, dinners, parties, free tickets to concerts, exclusive content, discussions, get advice etc with the users who have invested the most in them.

Creators get:
To realize profits from the platform through “creator rewards” where the creator receives 1% of all the transactions of their social currency. Basically whenever someone buys or sells the coin, the creator gets a 1% profit.
To increase their fandom, and broaden their reach.
And this is just the beginning
 

What are Fcoins?
Fcoins are Famance’s very own proprietary currency through which users can buy social currencies.

Rough logic flow (detailed)
The amount in Fcoins you enter will give you back the amount of social currencies you would be getting in return. This logic is based on the polynomial curve which is based on the formula:
Y = 0.003 * X^2
Where X is the total social currency supply
And Y is the amount of Fcoins required to buy X social currencies
And now the minted social currency you just bought is transferred from the smart contract to your own Fwallet.
